<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>They have a small family-run local business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012 and are hoping to improve their business by getting on the Internet.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> They create custom cosplay and fancy dress costumes and run a monthly cosplay party. They get about 30 people to the parties each month and make about 4 costumes per week which is not enough. The website should help them be more successful at these.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience is mostly people of the age between 35 to 50 years. They want the site to appeal to a younger audience than this, getting high school kids and young adults cosplaying.</p>
